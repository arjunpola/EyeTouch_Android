            "Indications": "Topical atropine is used as a cycloplegic, to temporarily paralyze the accommodation reflex and as a mydriatic, to dilate the pupils. Atropine degrades slowly, typically wearing off in 7 to 14 days. Atropine induces mydriasis by blocking contraction of the circular pupillary sphincter muscle and dilates the pupil. Atropine induces cycloplegia by paralyzing the ciliary muscles, whose action inhibits accommodation to allow accurate refraction in children, helps to relieve pain associated with iridocyclitis, and treats ciliary block &#40;malignant&#41; glaucoma.

These associations reflect the specific changes of warm, dry skin from decreased sweating, blurry vision, decreased sweating&frasl;lacrimation, vasodilation, and central nervous system effects on muscarinic receptors, type 4 and 5 collectively known as anticholinergic toxidrome.",

            "History": "Mandragora &#40;mandrake&#41; was described by Theophrastus in the fourth century B.C. for treatment of wounds, gout, and sleeplessness, and as a love potion. Atropine extracts from the Egyptian henbane were used by Cleopatra in the last century B.C. to dilate her pupils, in the hope that she would appear more alluring. In the Renaissance, women used the juice of the berries of Atropa belladonna to enlarge the pupils of their eyes, for cosmetic reasons."
